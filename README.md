# cwhInternal-sql
Creating a project that is a comic book database for users to cross-reference and confirm comics they have as well as gather information on other comics.

## Expectations
I am using this project to grow my knowledge of c#, .net, MVC, sql data warehousing, SQL data manipulation, SQL reporting to create a fun, interactive, and rewarding application where users can get into and grow their knowledge of comics.
